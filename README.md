# Interactive Comments Section

## About

This project is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io). It represents the most challenging task I have undertaken on this platform. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this challenge, as it not only enhanced my skills in building UI with React and TailwindCSS but also deepened my understanding of handling nested objects. The current implementation utilizes localStorage for data storage, but future plans include integrating backend functionality.

## What I Learned from This Challenge

- Proficiency in working with nested objects (CRUD operations)
- Experience with Redux
- Understanding of Context API (initially built with Context API, now using Redux)
- Creation of custom React Hooks
- Increased familiarity with React and TailwindCSS
