# Frontend Mentor - Interactive comments section

## About this project

This is the challenge from [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io).
This is the hardest challenge I have ever done on this website. And I also love this challenge. Because not only I learned building UI with React && TailwindCSS but also how to work with nested objects. How to add, delete, update nested objects using recursion.
Currently I'm using localStorage to save data. But in the future I gonna add backend functions to this project.

## What I gained from this challenge

- How to work with nested objects (adding || deleting || updating)
- How to work with Context API in React
- How to build own Hooks in React
- More familiar with React && TailwindCSS
